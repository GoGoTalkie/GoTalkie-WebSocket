## 🎨 Features

### Supported File Types
- **C/C++**: .c, .cpp, .h, .hpp, .cc, .cxx
- **Python**: .py
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: .js, .ts, .jsx, .tsx
- **Java**: .java
- **Go**: .go
- **Rust**: .rs
- **Web**: .html, .css, .json, .xml
- **Other**: .sql, .sh, .bat, .md, .txt

### Syntax Highlighting
- Language-specific keywords (C, C++, Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, Rust)

- Dark theme (VS Code-inspired)

### File Size Limit

- **File Preview Modal**: Full-featured code viewer with line numbers
- **File Attachment Card**: Displays in chat messages with file info
- **Preview Button**: Eye icon (👁️) to view received files

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 🧪 Testing

1. Start the Go backend server
2. Start the React dev server
3. Open two browser tabs
4. Login with different names
5. Start a private chat or create/join a group
6. Click the 📎 button
7. Select a code file
8. Preview with syntax highlighting
9. Send the file
10. Verify the recipient can view it

## 🎯 Key Features

✅ **File Upload** - Drag or click to upload code files  
✅ **Syntax Highlighting** - 7 languages supported  
✅ **Preview Modal** - Professional code viewer  
✅ **Private & Group** - Send files in any chat  
✅ **Responsive** - Works on desktop and mobile  
✅ **TypeScript** - Fully typed with strict mode  
✅ **React Hooks** - Modern React patterns  
✅ **File Validation** - Type and size checking  

## 📊 Component Structure

```
App.tsx
├── ChatArea
│   ├── FilePreviewModal (upload preview)
│   ├── FilePreviewModal (received file preview)
│   └── Messages
│       └── FileMessage (attachment cards)
```

## 🔒 Security

- Client-side file type validation
- 2MB size limit prevents large uploads
- HTML escaping in syntax highlighter (XSS prevention)
- No persistent storage (files in WebSocket messages only)

## 💡 Usage Flow

### Sending a File
1. User clicks 📎 button
2. Browser file picker opens (filtered by type)
3. User selects file
4. FileReader reads content
5. FilePreviewModal shows with syntax highlighting
6. User clicks "Send File"
7. File data sent via WebSocket
8. File appears in chat for both users

### Viewing a Received File
1. File attachment appears in chat
2. User clicks "👁️ Preview"
3. FilePreviewModal opens with code
4. User can scroll/read code
5. User clicks "Close"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Build errors?**
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check TypeScript errors with `npm run build`

**File not uploading?**
- Check file size (must be < 2MB)
- Verify file extension is supported
- Check browser console for errors

**Preview not showing?**
- Ensure WebSocket connection is active
- Check browser console for React errors

## 📝 Next Steps

The feature is fully implemented! You can now:
- Test file uploads in private and group chats
- Customize syntax highlighting colors in `FilePreviewModal.css`
- Add more file types by updating the `FILE_TYPES` constant
- Extend syntax highlighting for more languages
